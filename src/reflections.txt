What is the effect of P, I & D components ?
P - controller:
The steering is directly proportional to the cross track error (CTE).
With a low, proportional gain the steer angle is not large enough to correct the CTE and the car drives off the track in corners.
With a large p-gain, the car starts swerving. It steers to correct the CTE, overshoots and then steers again in opposite direction


PD controller:
In addition to the proportional component, the steering angle depends on an additional derivative component that is proportional to change in error between two time steps.
This helps damp the oscillations due to p-component since it starts reducing the steering angle as CTE reduces.
This improved the driving a lot in straight line and and made driving through bends much more stable.


PID controller
When using a PID controller, there is an integral component that depends on the cumulative CTE error which helps solves problems like systemic bias.
When using the PID controller, the car tries to stay more in the middle of the track.


Tuning of PID controller:
The controller was tuned manually for this project.
The twiddle process has been implemented but it was not used to tune the controller
Currently the car is able to get around the track at ~30MPH approx with gains (P: 0.1, I:0.0008, D:0.8)


Notes and observations:
1. There are some unexpected CTE jumps even when the car is in the center of a straight patch.
2. This controller did not allow the car to keep a stable steering angle in bends. A human driver can usually keep the steering angle constant in bends

Future efforts:
1. Extend controller and add some speed controller to try higher speeds
2. Try to use more techniques - sgd, root locus
